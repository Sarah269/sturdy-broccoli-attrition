User Story:  Attrition ML App Prediction
As an analyst, I want to input parameters related to an employee into an application, 
so that I can get a prediction on whether the employee will leave the company. 

Acceptance Criteria:
- The application allows me to select or input appropriate values for each parameter.
- Upon submission of the parameters, the application processes the input and generates a prediction.
- The prediction is displayed on the screen, indicating whether the employee will leave or stay.

User Story: Attrition ML App Predication Accuracy
As an analyst, I want to see the probability of the prediction's accuracy alongside the prediction itself, 
so that I can better understand the confidence level of the model's output and make informed decisions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- After submitting the parameters, the application displays a prediction result indicating the likelihood of attrition.
- Alongside the prediction, the application provides a probability score representing the accuracy of the prediction.

User Story: Department Attrition Visualization
As an analyst, I want to see a visual representation of employee attrition by department so that I can analyze trends 
and identify departments with higher attrition rates.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The app displays pie charts showing the proportion of employees who have left versus those who remain, segmented by department.
- Each department has a separate visualization to highlight attrition distribution.

User Story: Attrition Metrics Overview
As an analyst, I want to view key attrition metrics across different employee demographics so that I can compare 
attrition rates among various groups.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The app displays a metric card showing the overall corporate attrition percentage.
- The app provides metric cards segmented by gender, showing attrition rates for male and female employees.
- The app presents metric cards by marital status, displaying attrition percentages for one or more categories (e.g., single, married).
